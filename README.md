# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official laravel installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/installation#installation)

Alternative installation is possible without local dependencies relying on [Docker](#docker). 

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/btcs-manhdd/p01-product-api.git

Switch to the repo folder

    cd p01-product-api

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate

Start the local development server

    php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000


## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, articles, comments, tags, favorites and follows. This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DummyDataSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeds/DummyDataSeeder.php

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh
    
## Docker

To install with [Docker](https://www.docker.com), run following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:gothinkster/laravel-realworld-example-app.git
cd laravel-realworld-example-app
cp .env.example.docker .env
docker run -v $(pwd):/app composer install
cd ./docker
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec php php artisan key:generate
docker-compose exec php php artisan jwt:generate
docker-compose exec php php artisan migrate
docker-compose exec php php artisan db:seed
docker-compose exec php php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0
```

The api can be accessed at [http://localhost:8000/api](http://localhost:8000/api).

## API Specification

This application adheres to the api specifications set by the [Thinkster](https://github.com/gothinkster) team. This helps mix and match any backend with any other frontend without conflicts.

# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
 
This applications has CORS enabled by default on all API endpoints. The default configuration allows requests from `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:4200` to help speed up your frontend testing. The CORS allowed origins can be changed by setting them in the config file. Please check the following sources to learn more about CORS.
